## Running locally

### Supabase

Supabase can be started through the CLI running

```shell
supabase start
```

### Worker

Start the Worker by running

```shell
yarn worker
```

### Make requests

To trigger the worker, `POST` requests should be made to http://localhost:4000 with a `Content-Type: application/json`
header and a body
looking like

```json
{
  "stateId": "",
  "eventName": "",
  "eventPayload": "",
  "settings": "",
  "ref": ""
}
```

For convenience you can find an `.http` file with a valid request [here](/tests/http/request.http).
