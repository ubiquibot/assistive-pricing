```

### Worker
Start the Worker by running

### Make requests
To trigger the worker, `POST` requests should be made to http://localhost:4000 with a `Content-Type: application/json`
header and a body
looking like
```json

```
For convenience you can find an `.http` file with a valid request [here](/tests/http/request.http).
